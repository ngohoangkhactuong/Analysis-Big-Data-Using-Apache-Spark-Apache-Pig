# Analysis-Big-Data-Using-Apache-Spark-Apache-Pig
  Analyze big data using Apache Spark and Apache Pig, two popular frameworks for big data processing. The project involves preparing the data, implementing analysis tasks in both Spark and Pig, and comparing the running speed of the code in each framework. The project aims to evaluate the performance of Spark and Pig, providing insights into their efficiency for big data analysis. The findings and recommendations from this project can help stakeholders make informed decisions when selecting the appropriate framework for their specific analysis needs.
